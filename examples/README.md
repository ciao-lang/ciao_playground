As mentioned in the documentation, the playground allows: 

a) Developing notebooks (Active Logic Documents) that include runnable
   and editable Prolog code examples.

b) Including in slides, manuals, books, web sites, articles,
   spreadsheets, etc., links that load Prolog code into the
   playground. This only requires that the tool used for editing the
   document allows including URLs. This includes of course Word,
   LaTeX, google docs, Jupyter notebooks, web site generators, etc.,
   etc.
   
Examples of a) can be found in the examples directory of the lpdoc
bundle.  This directory contains some examples of b).
